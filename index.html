              Created in conjunction with four other team members, I was responsible
              for all interactions on this website. I also contributed heavily to the CSS and
              overall theme of the website. During group meetings, I lead discussion, delegated
              work, and helped her teammates complete their portions.

              This website was made for ART 101 at UCSC taught by Wes Modes during Spring 2022.

              In Nequam Mountain, the undead seeks to rise again. Warriors from the past have left items to aid you quest,

              For this project, we wanted to create an extremely unforgiving hack-and-slash RPG.
              I was responsible for coordinating all group members by creating a development plan,
              running meetings, and keeping track of tasks to complete.
              I also contributed to level design, programming, story, and other assorted art.

              This game was made using the free version of Construct3 for CMPM 80k at UCSC taught by Tad Leckman and Noah Wardrip-Fruin
              during Winter 2022.

              What do you do after something unbearable happens to someone you love?

              In this interactive narrative, I wanted to look at loss and depression from an outside perspective.
              I worked in monotone to set the tone and used text placement and font to differentiate
              between each voice.

              A story about a cat that always ends horribly.
              <br><br>
              In this branching narrative, I played with a contrast between a silly visual aesthetic and a
              sad and dark topic. I wanted to explore surface level success and an unhealthy obsession with
              work, both of which are topics that I'm very familiar with.
