              Alia Toth-Smith is mixed-media role-playing game maker, fiction writer, and 
              reluctant programmer from the San Francisco Bay Area. They're currently 
              most interested in exploring table top role-playing games and short, 
              story-focused games. They are currently pursuing their B.A. in Art and Design: 
              Games and Playable Media and are expected to graduate in 2024.
              <br><br>
              In their quest to know 
              a little about everything, they also dabble in video editing, sound designing, 
              graphic designing, acting, singing, macram√©ing, jewelry making and painting. 
              Their other hobbies include playing with their dog, writing aimless conversations, 
              spying, and spending time with their family.
              <br><br>
              In Spring 2021, they worked as an assistant director on the French play for the 
              Miriam Ellis International Playhouse.
