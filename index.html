              Created in conjunction with four other team members, she was responsible
              for all interactions on this website. She also contributed heavily to the CSS and
              overall theme of the website. During group meetings, she led discussion, delegated
              work, and helped her teammates complete their portions.

              For this project, the team wanted to create an extremely unforgiving hack-and-slash RPG.
              She was responsible for coordinating all group members by creating a development plan,
              running meetings, and keeping track of tasks to complete.
              She also contributed to level design, programming, story, and other assorted art.

              In this interactive narrative, she wanted to look at loss and depression from an outside perspective.
              She worked in grayscale to set the tone and used text placement and font to differentiate
              between each voice.

              <i>A story about a cat that always ends horribly.</i>
              <br><br>
              This branching narrative aims to explore surface level success and an unhealthy obsession with work.
              In it, she played with a contrast between a silly visual aesthetic and a dark topic to make her point.
