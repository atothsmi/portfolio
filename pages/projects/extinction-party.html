                  This project was designed to raise awareness on human's role in extinction. 
                  It features 10 animals that are already extinct due to human actions and ends 
                  with a call to action that references other endangered animals.

                  This website was created with a team, credited below. I functioned as the primary programmer 
                  and project manager. I was responsible for all of the interactions on the website. I also 
                  contributed to the theme of the website and the CSS design. We met several times over the course 
                  of three months (one quarter of university). During those meetings, I lead discussion on the 
                  project, delegated work, and helped teammates troubleshoot their tasks when needed.

                  While this website is certainly imperfect, it was an excellent exercise in website design and 
                  programming with javascript. It also provided several insights into how to work as a group and how 
                  to delegate tasks while balancing everyone's strengths and weaknesses.
