                  I started out with the idea that I wanted to make a project that was visually silly 
                  and textually sad/dark. I started by writing out my story on paper and using a numbering 
                  system to plan out the next scene I had to write in a sequence.

                    I settled on writing about a cat that does nothing in his life but work and then he dies, 
                    because people do this in real life, but when it’s about cats people automatically think it’s 
                    going to be silly. To highlight the visual silliness, I imported two fonts from Google Fonts, 
                    Gluten and Dongle. The soft, irregular curves of each of these fonts sends a happy message that 
                    completely contrasts from the text content. I drew all of the images in an online photo editor 
                    and heavily reused elements in order to make it seem even more storybook or kid-like. Here is my 
                    final diagram of my story.

                    I created one ending that was loosely only accessible if the player had gone through and remembered 
                    the other branches. Of course, the player could just guess their way to the ending, but it is easier 
                    to access that ending if the player has seen everything else.
