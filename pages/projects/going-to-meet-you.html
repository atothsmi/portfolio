                  <i>going to meet you</i>  is a physical tower-building and balance game 
                  that follows a soul as it climbs up a tree and recounts the events of its 
                  life. The player alternates stacking 'branches' and 'trunks'. In between each stack, the player must move the soul, represented by a white clay figurine onto a new section of branch. When the figure is moved the previous space is coved by a card from the 'memory deck' that reveals a snippet of the soul's ongoing monologue. If the tree falls, the rest of the memory deck is torn up and tossed haphazardly into the box, forever obsuring the soul's story and resolution.

                  While making this game, I was focused on challenging my aesthetic design skills and creating a game that was consistent through all of its pieces: from theme to visuals to mechanics. I started with the stacking mechanic and the idea of finality. From those mechanics, I decided that the themes of nature and death would fit well for the visual aesthetic. Those themes produced a narrative that deals with the fear of regret which I felt also paired nicely with the mechanics. With these main pillars decided on, I was able to flex my physical construction muscles to create over 50 'tree' pieces, each of which had to snap onto each other in order to create the hight and resulting uncertainty I was going for. Unexpectedly, I also learned about how to size prints correctly and what color values to use for online viewing verses physical printing, as I compiled the memory deck over many iterations.

                  I started out with the idea that I wanted to make a project that was visually silly 
                  and textually sad/dark. I started by writing out my story on paper and using a numbering 
                  system to plan out the next scene I had to write in a sequence.

                    I settled on writing about a cat that does nothing in his life but work and then he dies, 
                    because people do this in real life, but when it’s about cats people automatically think it’s 
                    going to be silly. To highlight the visual silliness, I imported two fonts from Google Fonts, 
                    Gluten and Dongle. The soft, irregular curves of each of these fonts sends a happy message that 
                    completely contrasts from the text content. I drew all of the images in an online photo editor 
                    and heavily reused elements in order to make it seem even more storybook or kid-like. Here is my 
                    final diagram of my story.

                    I created one ending that was loosely only accessible if the player had gone through and remembered 
                    the other branches. Of course, the player could just guess their way to the ending, but it is easier 
                    to access that ending if the player has seen everything else.
