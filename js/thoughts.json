They weren't too special, the resolutions themselves, always about losing weight or being happier in some way, but the tradition, that was special. It was a way to document our place in life, leave a bookmark for future us to look back on. My resolutions ranged from aspiring to be diabolical and whimsical allusions to theoretically possible goals. I loved looking back on them, because each one brought me back to the mindset when I made it and I'd get a flash of the past. I'd embody that moment so many years ago, even just for a second.\n", "\n", "This year, due to circumstances outside our control, we couldn't be togther on New Years. So the first week of January passed and then the next and now it's the last day of January and I've come to the conclusion this is a year of no new resolutions. No aspirations except surviving and sometimes not even that. So much is changing in my life right now and I have no will to shape that change in any way. I'm a rock in a river, slowly being worn away.\n", "\n", "The worst part is that I know this isn't the first time I've written something like this.
